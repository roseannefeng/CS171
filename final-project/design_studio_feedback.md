Feedback from Rebecca Mazur

> I think this sounds like a great plan and should be easily within scope.

> Just want to make sure of what I'm seeing -- no bar charts on the prototype yet?  Is that correct?

At the time of the design studio, there was no bar chart. A bar chart will be added for the final submission of the project.

> One minor thing I would do to the vis itself is put a loading indicator on it -- I know this is usually a polishing step, so you might already be thinking in that direction, but I was a little confused when it took a while before I started seeing tooltips.

This is a very good idea. We have been working on trying to find a way to speed up the loading of the data but since it does take a little while for the program to load we will look at adding a loading indicator.

> Being able to choose timespans is a nice touch.  Glad you've moved that to a "must have" -- I was going to recommend that until I read the process book and saw it already there.

Given the feedback from the project proposal, we have been attempting to add many more options and analysis into our project rather than just having a simple choropleth map.

> Good that you're using the tooltips and bar charts to make up for the downsides of using color; that's important.

> One danger to watch out for is that it's clear the bar-chart is being populated when it's under the map (thinking ahead here only because I've run into the same problem with my own vis).  On my tiny laptop the chart will be off-screen for certain.  There are interesting things you can do to make it clear that you updated it, animations, a scroll to put the chart in view, etc.

We will have too look at that and may have to rearrange things on the screen for the final submission. A storytelling aspect of the project might also explain and show off the full visualization so that the user is aware of all the options.

> I'm not quite clear on what the chord diagram is doing right now, but I'm assuming you all are working on that.

We will look at labelling everything better and maybe adding a description so that the user is aware of what the different data is showing for the final submision.

> Anyway, great plan and a good start.  Can't wait to see it finished!

I think the feedback we received was fair and helpful. We will look for ways to make the user aware of all the features of the visualization and what the data represents.
