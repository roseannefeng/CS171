1. Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area. <br />
The  SVG element/rectangle with class background shows the specific part of the overview that we're interacting with.

2. Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection. <br />
The SVG element/rectangle with class extent shows the range of the selection.

3. What are the other DOM elements for? <br />
As far as I can tell, they're mostly for organization. The "resize e" and "resize w" elements allow you to drag on the left or right side of the box that shows you what's been brushed over, so you can expand or shrink what you're looking at.
