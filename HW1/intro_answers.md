1) If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

You could highlight, color, or otherwise draw attention to the minimum/maximum row. You could also create a new column to display the rate relative to the mean or mode (ex. 2 times as high). You could bold outliers.

2) Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.

[Wikipedia's list of Korean family names](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names) - Allows for sorting by different columns, including relative popularity, different transliterations, relatively simple lookup of information, etc

[Wikipedia's list of countries by alcohol consumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption) - Again, allows sorting, also has further subcategories of alcohol that can be looked at separately or as a whole.

[Excel spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sM772m_ydvPzlBfeZ9-uXDXCMHgjbwXp7Y9ArhA2EIg/edit#gid=1863678430), ex. I use this one for my personal use for a dragon breeding game, allows for sorting by breed, filtering out unnecessary categories/focusing on specific categories, automatically designates colors where appropriate, keeps count of certain types of dragons to the side.
